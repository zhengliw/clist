# Clist - A multi-mode linked list library/implementation

Nothing in here right now. But I will make this repo big.

Appearently, a lot of people are already cloning this repo, as 
I can see. Thanks for the attention, but I am sorry to say that
this project is just beginning right now and not ready at all. 
There isn't even any runnable code yet!

But if you are interested, please do me a favor and star this 
repository, since I have big plans. Thanks!
